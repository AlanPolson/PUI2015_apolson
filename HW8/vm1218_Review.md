# Review Venkat's plot 

![Venkat's plot](Venkat_plot.png)

## INITIAL OBSERVATIONS

Impressive, detailed and professional. Slightly overwhelming. Perhaps too much going on?

**Note:** *Although the maps in this infographic are aesthetically pleasing and clear, this critique does not cover them, since they are more GIS-based. I have restricted myself to the two plots on the lower right hand corner of the Graphic.*

----
## CLARITY

1. Missing axes labels for both plots.
2. Missing legends for both plots. We don't know what is being stacked.
3. Plot 1: Why does the X axis start so far away from the start of the plot?
4. While pointing out significant incidents with stars is great for telling a story, it would be better if the call-out labels didn't obscure the graph, as they do in plot #2. 
5. Because of the absence of labels and legends, we really have no clue what is happening here, so I am unable to gauge whether the caption underneath each plot is as random as to seems to be here

## AESTHETIC

The plots could definitely be larger. There is no discernible need to start the first plot from 19th July instead of 7th Dec.
However, the choice of colors for the stacking provides sufficient contrast to be able to distinguish them even though the size is small. 

** *However* ** It is not conducive to color-blind people, as reds and greens have been stacked one on top of the other.

## HONESTY

The plots could do with some better framing of context, in terms of what the stacks mean and why the plots start where they do.
This is a time series plot, but only the troughs are explained, not the peaks. In fact, the graphs highlight those troughs quite prominently, with large callout labels which draw the reader's attention. This might mislead some readers to focus only on the points that are elaborated on, instead of letting the graph speak for itself.

## SUGGESTIONS

* It might be better to reduce the amount of content in the figure, as well as on the two plots. 
* Perhaps monthly dates alone could be shown on the X axis, and the remaining dates represented by tick-marks.
* Legends, labels, etc, must be added to the plot.
