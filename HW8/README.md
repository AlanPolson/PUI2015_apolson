# Assignment #8

## Part 1:

My plot is from our summer bootcamp, where we had to re-create a given plot in python. The original file can be seen [here](Alan_Polson_Core_Challenge.py). An [ipython notebook](Assignment8.ipynb) in which I started modifying the plot is also included. If you wish to run these files, please remember t download the [citibike data for July 2014](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201406-citibike-tripdata.zip) as well.
The final plot looks like this:
