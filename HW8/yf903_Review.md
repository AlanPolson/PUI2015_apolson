----
## INITIAL OBSERVATIONS
Very basic.

----
## CLARITY
**Positives:**

Title and labelled axes make this plot easy to understand and draw some inferences from.

**Lacking:** 

1. Legend.

2. Units along X and Y Axes (Emissions in Tonnes/pounds? Density per sq.foot/Meter?)

3. Spell check. 'Capita' spelt wrong in title, 'Density' spelt wrong in X Axis.

4. Technically, Its 'Emmissions per Capita vs Log Population Density', not the other way around.

----
## AESTHETIC
IMHO: 
>Minimilism is good for clarity. It is not itself attractive, but seeks to display the subject matter honestly. In other words, Minimilism is only as beautiful as the subject matter.

1. I don't think a minimalist design worked for this plot.
2. In addition, I cannot see the significance of the choice of color and symbols. Why blue? Why red? Why dots? It does not appear like any thought has been put into these aspects.

----
## HONESTY

The green line may be wrong. How is it meeting the X axis near x=3? What is pulling it down so far? And what is pulling the Red line up so much near x=0, x>3?

----
## SUGGESTIONS
1. **Clarity:** Add in the lacking parts of the plot specified above.
2. **Beauty:** You could add in a third dimension - Say total population of the city, and change the color scheme to green, and perhaps change the background colour of the plot to light blue, so that the plot ends up looking like poison gas bubbles polluting the sky.
3. **Honesty:** Check your plot. If it is right, and there is indeed an inflection point, it might improve **clarity** to highlight that point, as that would be the result of your research.
